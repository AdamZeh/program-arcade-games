  1. Write code to swap the values 25 and 40.
     
     my_list = [55, 41, 52, 68, 45, 27, 40, 25, 37, 26]
     
  2. Write code to swap the values 2 and 27.
     
     my_list = [27, 32, 18,  2, 11, 57, 14, 38, 19, 91]
     
  3. Why does the following code not work?
     
     my_list = [70, 32, 98, 88, 92, 36, 81, 83, 87, 66]
     temp = list[0]
     my_list[1] = list[0]
     my_list[0] = temp
     
  4. Show how the following numbers can be sorted using the selection sort. Show
     the numbers after each iteration of the outer loop, similar to what is shown
     in Figure 17.5. I am not looking for a copy of the code to do the sort.
     
     97   74    8   98   47   62   12   11    0   60
     
  5. Show how the following numbers can be sorted using the selection sort:
     
     74   92   18   47   40   58    0   36   29   25
     
  6. Show how the following numbers can be sorted using the INSERTION sort.
     (Note: If you think the 0 gets immediately sorted into position, you are doing
     it wrong. Go back and re-read how this sort works.)
     
     74   92   18   47   40   58    0   36   29   25
     
  7. Show how the following numbers can be sorted using the insertion sort:
     
     37   11   14   50   24    7   17   88   99    9
     
  8. Explain what min_pos does in the selection sort.

  9. Explain what cur_pos does in the selection sort.

 10. Explain what scan_pos does in the selection sort.

 11. Explain what key_pos and key_value are in the insertion
     sort.

 12. Explain scan_pos in the insertion sort.

 13. (5 pts) Look at the example sort program in the examples section here:
     http://programarcadegames.com/python_examples/f.php?file=sorting_examples.py
     Modify the sorts to print the number of times the inside loop is run, and the
     number of times the outside loop is run.
     Modify the program to work with a list of 100.
     Paste the code you used here.
     Run the program and list the numbers you got here. (Don't forget this part!)
