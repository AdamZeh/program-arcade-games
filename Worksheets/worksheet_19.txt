     When answering these questions, remember that recursion is not simple ``repeating''
     a task over and over. That could be done by a loop. A loop isn't recursion.
     Recursion is anything that is defined in terms of itself.
     
  1. ``To understand recursion, one must first understand recursion.'' Explain
     the joke. (Make sure to ask if you don't get this or the ones below.)
  2. Two mirrors face each other. Explain how their reflections demonstrate the
     property of recursion.
  3. Explain how Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) uses recursion.
     If you don't know what MLM is, look it up. Also, pro-life tip: avoid MLM.
  4. Explain how the ``sweep'' function in the classic minesweeper game could be
     done with recursion. If you don't know, ask!
  5. Explain how finding your way out of a maze could be done with recursion.
  6. Use the Chrome browser and create your own screenshot at:
     http://juliamap.googlelabs.com
     Use your mouse and mouse wheel to zoom into an interesting part of the fractal.
     Copy the URL and paste it here.
  7. (5 pts) Write a recursive function f(n) that takes in a value n
     and returns the value for f, given the definition below.
     (If you are viewing this in a text file, the line below will look like
     gibberish. Go on-line or look in the book for the correctly formatted equation.)

     $f_{n} = \begin{cases} 6 & \text{if } n = 1, \\ \frac{1}{2}f_{n-1}+4 & \text{if } n > 1. \end{cases}$

     Then write a for loop that prints out the answers for values of n
     from 1 to 10. It should look like:
     
     n= 1 , a= 6
     n= 2 , a= 7.0
     n= 3 , a= 7.5
     n= 4 , a= 7.75
     n= 5 , a= 7.875
     n= 6 , a= 7.9375
     n= 7 , a= 7.96875
     n= 8 , a= 7.984375
     n= 9 , a= 7.9921875
     n= 10 , a= 7.99609375
     

     The function should not have any print statements inside it, nor a loop. The for
     loop that is written should be outside the function and call the function to get
     the results and print them.

  8. (5 pts) Write recursive code that will print out the first 10 terms of the
     sequence below. (If you are viewing this in a text file, the line below will
     look like gibberish. Go on-line or look in the book for the correctly formatted
     equation.)

     $f_{n} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } n = 1, \\ 1 & \text{if } n = 2, \\ f(n-1)+f(n-2) & \text{if } n > 2. \end{cases}$
