  1. (6 pts) Define the following terms in your own words. Don't just copy/paste
     from the book:
     
     * Exception
     * Exception Handling
     * Try block
     * Catch block
     * Unhandled exception
     * Throw
     
  2. Show how to modify the following code so that an error is printed if the
     number conversion is not successful. Modify this code, don't just copy
     the example from the text. Do NOT ask again if the conversion is
     unsuccessful.
     
     user_input_string = input("Enter a number:")
     user_value = int(user_input_string)
     
  3. What will the following code output? Predict, and then run the code to see
     if you are correct. Write your prediction here and if you are right. If you
     aren't, make sure you understand why. (Make sure to write both the prediction,
     and the actual results. No credit will be given if you just list the results
     or the prediction. If the program raises an error, list that fact for this and
     the next problem as well.)
     
     x = 5
     y = 0
     print("A")
     try:
         print("B")
         a = x / y
         print("C")
     except:
         print("D")
     print("E")
     print(a)
     
  4. What will the following code output? Predict, and then run the code to see
     if you are correct. Write your prediction here and if you are right. If you
     aren't, make sure you understand why.
     
     x = 5
     y = 10
     print("A")
     try:
         print("B")
         a = x / y
         print("C")
     except:
         print("D")
     print("E")
     print(a)
