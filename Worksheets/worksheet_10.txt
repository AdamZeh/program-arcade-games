  1. What's wrong with this code that uses a function to draw a stick figure?
     Assume the colors are already defined and the rest of the program is ok.
     What is wrong with the code in the function?
     
     def draw_stick_figure(screen, x, y):
         # Head
         pygame.draw.ellipse(screen, BLACK, [96,83,10,10], 0)

         # Legs
         pygame.draw.line(screen, BLACK, [100,100], [105,110], 2)
         pygame.draw.line(screen, BLACK, [100,100], [95,110], 2)

         # Body
         pygame.draw.line(screen, RED, [100,100], [100,90], 2)

         # Arms
         pygame.draw.line(screen, RED, [100,90], [104,100], 2)
         pygame.draw.line(screen, RED, [100,90], [96,100], 2)
     
  2. Show how to only grab the x coordinate of where the mouse is.
  3. Why is it important to keep the event processing loop ``together''
     and only have one of them? It is more than organization, there will be subtle
     hard-to-detect errors. What are they and why will they happen without the
     event processing loop together? (Review ``The Event Processing Loop'' in
     Chapter 5 if needed.)
  4. When we created a bouncing rectangle, we multiplied the speed times -1 when
     the rectangle hit the edge of the screen. Explain why that technique won't work
     for moving an object with the keyboard.
  5. Why does movement with the keyboard or game controller need to have a
     starting x, y location, but the mouse doesn't?
  6. What values will a game controller return if it is held all the way down
     and to the right?
