  1. (10 pts) Start with the program at the end of Chapter 16. Modify it so that
     rather than just changing the block the user clicks on, also change the blocks
     of the squares next to the user's click. If the user clicks on an edge, make
     sure the program doesn't crash and still handles the click appropriately. Paste
     into the worksheet you turn in.

  2. (10 pts) Write a celebrity-finding function. 
     Start with a function check_celebrity that takes an n by n matrix
     named grid as a parameter. 
     The grid location grid[i][j] = 1 if person i knows person j 
     and grid[i][j] = 0 otherwise.
     (Assume that grid[i][i] = 1 for every i, since every person knows him/herself.)
     A celebrity is a person who is known by everyone and does not know anyone
     besides him/herself.

     Write a function that given the matrix grid, prints all the
     celebrities.

     For example, in the following grid person 2 is a celebrity:
     
          0  1  2  3
       --------------
     0 |  1  1  1  0
     1 |  0  1  1  0
     2 |  0  0  1  0
     3 |  1  0  1  1
     
     In the next example no one is a celebrity:
     
          0  1  2  3  4
       ----------------
     0 |  1  1  1  0  1
     1 |  0  1  1  0  1
     2 |  0  0  1  0  0
     3 |  1  0  1  1  1
     4 |  1  0  0  1  1
     
     Remember: A matrix can be represented as a list-of-lists, where each sub-list
     is a row of the matrix. For example, the first matrix can be represented as:
     
     grid = [ [1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1] ]
     
     Or you can use multiple lines to define the grid:
     
     grid = [ [1, 1, 1, 0],
              [0, 1, 1, 0],
              [0, 0, 1, 0],
              [1, 0, 1, 1] ]
     

     You can test your function with code like the following test cases:
     
     print("Test 1, Should show #2 is a celebrity.")
     grid = [ [1, 1, 1, 0],
              [0, 1, 1, 0],
              [0, 0, 1, 0],
              [1, 0, 1, 1] ]

     check_celebrity(grid)

     print("Test 2, Should show no one is a celebrity.")
     grid = [ [1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
              [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
              [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
              [1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
              [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] ]

     check_celebrity(grid)

     print("Test 3, Should show #2 is a celebrity.")
     grid = [ [1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
              [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
              [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
              [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] ]

     check_celebrity(grid)

     print("Test 4, Should show no one is a celebrity.")
     grid = [ [1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
              [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
              [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
              [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] ]

     check_celebrity(grid)
